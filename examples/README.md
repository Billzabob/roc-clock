# Examples

These are examples of how to make basic CLI (command-line interface) and apps using `basic-cli` as a platform.

Feel free to ask [on Zulip](https://roc.zulipchat.com) in the `#beginners` channel if you have questions about making
CLI apps, or if there are operations you'd like to see added to this platform (for
an application you'd like to build in Roc).
